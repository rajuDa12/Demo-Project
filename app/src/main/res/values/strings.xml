            FORMULA:\n
            DecimalNumber=nth bit × 2n−1\nSolved Examples\n
            Question 1: Convert 0110101 to decimal\n
            Solution:\nConverting binary to decimal number or decimal to binary number is an easy task.\n
            But, you need to be careful that not mix up the two sets of numbers.\n
            For instance, if you write the digits 10 on the page it could mean the number “ten” if we assume it to be a decimal number,\n
            or it could equally be a “1” and a “0” together in binary,\n
            which is equal to the number two in the weighted decimal format from above table.\n
            0110101 = (0 × 26) + (1 × 25) + (1 × 24) + (0 × 23) + (1 × 22) + (0 × 21) + (0 × 20).\n
            = 0 + 32 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0.\n
            = 52.\n
